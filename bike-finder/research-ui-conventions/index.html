    <div>
        <h2>Tesla (Tesla Vehicle)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Front page of Tesla immediately directs you to several models displayed in the top center navigation and the ability to make a "Custom Order"
                or review their "Existing Inventory" as prominent choices
            </li>
            <li>
                Since I was intending to buy a car, I clicked on "Shop" in top right navigation; this was the incorrect thing to do, as "Shop"
                directs to apparel/additions and not the actual cars.
            </li>
            <li>
                "Custom Order" takes me to page to customize the Tesla; long, continuous right side panel contains all elements that are customizable,
                clickable elements are clearly emphasized with radius and highlight and scrolling to a certain section will automatically change
                central image to display that part of the car (ex. Interior selection will display interior photo of car)
            </li>
            <li>Adding and removing additional features will automatically add the additional cost onto the "Vehicle Price" at the bottom of the page</li>
            <li>
                Item that takes up most of the screen is visual image of car, exteriror and interior, scroll through photos with arrow buttons,
                very clear UI element with predictable action of changing the image displayed
            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking on the "Vehicle Price" panel at the bottom generates a pop-up: "Finance Options" - provides the user with editable fields so they
                can determine the affordability of the car based on their own financial parameters
            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking on a dropdown arrow next to "Finance Options" also brings up "Gas Savings" and "Incentives" which also allow user to input information
                to find out a certain amount of money they could save (ex. inputing a certain state in "Incentives" can display benefits the user might receive for buying the car);
                I had some general idea of what these features would do after clicking around a bit and adjusting the value fields; editable and non-editable fields were clearly
                denoted
            </li>
            <li>Dropdown selection fields used for when there are established/common values (ex. 36, 48, 60 months) versus user type in fields for user-specific values (ex. $ Downpayment, Annual Miles)</li>
            <li>
                Changing the finance option will change the "Vehicle Price" to the payment option the user chose (ex. $46,490 vs. $472/month); I would say this is
                pretty successful in encouraging the user to purchase the product by accomodating different ways the user could afford the car & it's a pretty helpful tool
            </li>
            <li>
                "Continue to Payment" - everything is still in right side panel, allows user to see all the changes they made to the car, shows a repeat of finance options so user can
                select "Cash", "Lease", or "Loan"; then you can input credit info & place the order
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Melissa's (Fresh Strawberries)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Home page has many colorful features and displays for their products, condensed dropdown menu, "Search", and "Cart" all located at top</li>
            <li>Hovering over a product will produce a small dropdown that allows the user to click "Quick Shop" or "Add to Cart"</li>
            <li>
                Typing in "strawberries" to the search bar brings up a dropdown of possible products the user may be looking for with an image, clicking on it takes you to
                a page about that product - provides some information and description about the strawberries & can add to wishlist, but there is no place to purchase/add it to the cart
            </li>
            <li>
                After clicking on and observing other fruits on the website, it seems if there is a not a red price listed beneath its photo in the produce's display card, it
                is either not in season or simply not available for purchase. In this case, the produce's display card is not the most helpful - I could not immediately tell
                the strawberries were not available and would have liked some indication before clicking on it and navigating to its page
            </li>
            <li>
                At the bottom is a "Inspired by your shopping trends" row and a "Recently Viewed" row; first row appears to provide recommendations on other produce, displaying a row
                of produce display cards; "Recently Viewed" is exactly how it sounds, might be useful if the user wants to navigate to something they saw previously/changed their mind on
            </li>
            <li>
                Because I could not get strawberries I chose a fruit that was available; hovering over its display card, the "Quick Shop" buttton opens a pop-up
                that allows me to set a Quantity/Pack and Quantity through dropdown selection; Quantity/Pack often does not have more than one option makes sense for those to be fairly standard;
                Quanity selection is the biggest issue: I cannot type my preferred quantity unless I select 10+ from the dropdown, in which it then lets me type in the field, but then I cannot
                revert back to the dropdown selection unless the page is refreshed. I can then add that quantity of that produce to my cart or but with Google Pay immediately. "Quick Shop"
                pop-up has exact same functionality as if you were to navigate to that produce's own seperate page.
            </li>
            <li>If "Add to Cart" is clicked instead, that produce is added to "Your Cart" with a default quantity of 1, and the user is brought to the cart page</li>
            <li>
                The user can still adjust quantity on the "Your cart" page, as well as remove an item and check its price total. This function is helpful, as it calculates your total and
                you can still make adjustments to your purchases.
            </li>
            <li>
                Checkout prompts the user to a seperate page for credit information, shipping, and payment; it displays a list of your purchases and total to the right side, which
                is helpful for a shopper to see as they confirm payment info.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>The Vitamin Shoppe (Vitamin C Tablets)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Home page has "Search", store location, "Sign In/Register", Reorder, and "Cart"; below is a navigation of type of items they sell;
                hovering over a selection in the navigation opens a dropdown that details further categories of the items
            </li>
            <li>
                Because I am shopping for Vitamin C supplements, I hover over "Vitamins & Supplements" tab and see that there is a category called "Letter Vitamins"
                where I can directly click "Vitamin C". The method of categorization is very helpful, as because there are so many products being sold, this is a very quick way to acces product I need.
            </li>
            <li>
                There is a product filter on the left hand side, where checking a box for a certain field immediately refreshes and filters the products that come up.
                Product display card has photo, name of product, reviews, price, and a "Add to Cart" button. I filtered to tablets, so it shows all the products that are
                Vitamin C tablets
            </li>
            <li>
                Adding the item to the cart creates a pop-up that indicates the item has been added. The user can then choose to "Continue Shopping", which closes the pop-up,
                or "View Cart and Checkout", which goes to the "Shopping Cart" page - displays all items in the cart, can adjust quantity and shipping here, provides subtotal and gives recommendations
                for more products at the bottom of the page. User can then check out.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Best Buy (Headphones)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Home page has dropdown "Menu", "Search" and "Cart" at top, below that a menu with deals and extraneous Best Buy content, "Account", "Order Status", etc.</li>
            <li>
                Immediately and prominently displays all of the products Best Buy carries with a photo example (ex. TVs, Laptops, Appliances, etc.);
                because I see heaphones in that list, I click there and do not go to "Search" like I did with the strawberries.
            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking on the "Headphones" category takes me to a page with all the headphone display cards - photo of the product, reviews, item name, price, and "Add to Cart" button;
                there is also a "Compare" checkbox that when checked opens a bottom panel that adds that product to the queue, displaying name and price for up to 4 items. This feature
                is pretty helpful as technology can be expensive, and a user might want to see multiple products and how they compare in price before purchasing. User can also save the product.
            </li>
            <li>Filter system to the left just like the previous vitamins page, also contains store pickup and shipping information</li>
            <li>Also a "Sort By:" selection that allows the user to sort alphabetically, by price, featured, etc.</li>
            <li>
                Clicking "Add to Cart" opens a pop-up that indicates the item was added to the cart. User can then "Go to Cart" which takes them to a seperate "Your Cart" page.
                Pop-up also prominently displays add-on warranty for the product, which a user can also add into their cart from within the pop-up. This is helpful to those who
                intend to purchase protection for their product but could be seen as a way to get the user to spend more money.
            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking on the item name will take user to item's page, where they can view image gallery of item, select color, and see more detailed reviews/ratings,
                but otherwise has the same functionality (add to cart, compare, save) as its condensed dispaly on the search page.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cart page allows user to change quantity, pick-up location, and add protection plan, as well as remove the item or save it. Changing the quantity (which is a dropdown, as there
                appears to be a limit on how many of a certain item you are allowed to purchase) will reconfigure the checkout page so that it creates a duplicate(s) of the product you increased
                the quantity of, adjusting the "Quantity" back to 1 for each of those items.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>What elements or patterns seem universal?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Left/Right arrow buttons always change the display/image to the left or the right, respectively</li>
            <li>Clickable buttons are always clearly denoted with outline/color change/rounded corners, highlights</li>
            <li>All the sites except for Tesla had a search bar and some sort of "Add to Cart" function and a page to view your cart.</li>
            <li>All had some form of menu, editable fields (type, dropdown, select button), and price display </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Did I see anything that felt different or unusual?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Best Buy's automatic duplication of the product in the cart page definitely felt new to me, but I believe when purchasing such expensive technology, it is actually a
                good idea to have every single item show up in the cart, rather than missing the fact a single number on the side might have been accidentally changed from 1 to 2.
            </li>
            <li>
                Melissa's lack of indication for whether a product was available or not was very unusual to me, the only indicator seemed to be if there was a price listed or not, but there
                was no other indicator on the product search display or its own page.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What elements or patterns were specific to the store or product?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Tesla was the only store that was significantly different from the standard online store layout, as it didn't have any of the standard online shopping features
                (cart, filtering products system, sorting, extensive menus), which makes sense for the product they're selling
            </li>
            <li>
                Melissa's was the only website that had the "Add to Cart" function as a seperate hover dropdown over their product display card, which I assume was to maintain the visual/aesthetic
                integrity of the site.
            </li>
            <li>Best Buy was the only site that performed an automatic duplication of the product in the cart if you changed its quantity. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Were there any patterns or techniques that made one store stand out? Could the other stores have applied that technique successfully?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Melissa's had an "x" icon to remove an item from the cart rather than some small text that says "remove" or "delete", which was much more visible and user-friendly for me to
                use than how it was on the Vitamin Shoppe or Best Buy website.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Vitamin Shoppe allows you to change quantity using a +/- button system (or typing in the field) rather than having a dropdown, which Melissa's and Best Buy both had,
                and I like that method better because it avoids excessively long dropdowns (Melissa's) and helps the user be more aware of how many items are being added to their cart and avoid misclicks.(Best Buy)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Finally, how did you feel when interacting with these sites? When were you happiest/most comfortable? When were you disrupted/confused/bothered?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The happiest/most comfortable was when a) I could get to the product I needed without having to type it into the search bar and b) when there were visuals and clear indicators of the flow of purchase.</li>
            <li>
                Best Buy's "Remove" option on the cart page is extremely small, I actually had spent a few seconds looking for where it was,
                and this was a bit upsetting to me even though it may be a tactic for the store to get more purchases.
            </li>
            <li>
                I also felt comfortable the fewer choices/clicks I had to make. What was nice about Tesla was that the purhcasing flow was very linear and contained (all within one long panel)
                so this made navigation really simple. It's add-on advertisements were also more subtle and seemed more integrated in the product, so that it wasn't just something shoved in your face
                at the end of the purchase process.
            </li>
        </ul>
