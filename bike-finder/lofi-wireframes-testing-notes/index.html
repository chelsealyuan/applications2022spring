   <h1>Testing Round 1</h1> 

   <ul>
    <li>Sees deals as very first thing - good for parent person</li>
    <li>Thought clicking “Bikes” in navigation went to search results </li>
    <li>Like she can see price and picture immediately </li>
    <li>Thought star ratings substitution was the different options (colors) for a bike </li>
    <li>Should specify where the star rating is </li>
    <li>Should add some color options and size options </li>
    <li>Bestseller banner is good to know which is most popular </li>
    <li>Hamburger style filters are good </li>
    <li>Customize is next to bike details is good because it easy to see and find </li>
    <li>Compare is under add to cart, helping the customer make the right decision </li>
    <li>Customize - might not help someone who doesn’t know much about bikes </li>
    <li>Like that she can see the estimated arrival time </li>
    <li>Good to see delete buttons big and clear </li>
    <li>Compare more information is good for particular personas </li>
    <li>Compare popup is good </li>
    <li>See one more detail on the compare panel pop-up </li>
    <li>Could certain specs on the compare page be closed like a hamburger menu? </li>
   </ul>


<h1>Testing Round 2</h1> 
<ul>
    <li>Should detail out bikes navigation > search results</li>
    <li>Thinks clicking compare all details will take you </li>
    <li>Good idea to use small banner in time corner to be “recommend by…”</li> 
    <li>Knew that the price range could be adjusted in filtered section</li>
    <li>Makes discount bikes - more obvious, maybe make a “sale” button, or have it as a tag or filter</li>
    <li>Can easily find where to get photos of the bike</li>
    <li>Zoom & location button to see details</li>
    <li>Include categories in dropdown nav (adult v kids) </li>
    <li>Remember to add size choice and sizing information </li>
    <li>Adding some filtering queries at top of page</li>
</ul>


<h1>Testing Round 3</h1> 
<ul> 
    <li>(Shannon) Has a specific bike in mind - mountain </li>
    <li>Personalizes search through filters </li>
    <li>has to assume the page will be updated based on filters</li>
    <li>Remember to add queries at top of page to indicate which filters were selected</li>
    <li>Accurately went through the entire process</li>
    <li>Finding accessories - helmet + compare </li>
    <li>Have a compare page for bikes => what about accessories?</li>
    <li>Shes not sure how to compare from the SEARCH page => maybe add a compare button?</li>
</ul>
