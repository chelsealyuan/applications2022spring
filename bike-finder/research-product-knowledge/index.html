    <h1>Product Knowledge</h1>
    <h3>January 23, 2022</h3>

    <h2>Online Research</h2>
    <h4>Source 1: <a href = "https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/bikes/buying-guide/index.htm"> Consumer Reports Bike Buying Guide</a></h3>
    <h4>Source 2: <a href = "https://www.yellowjersey.co.uk/the-draft/buying-a-bike/"> Ultimate Beginner Guide to Buying a Bicycle</a></h3>
<p>I used these sources to gain some general knowledge about bikes (of which I had none before) and because they function as guides, I used them to determine some things a buyer might 
    consider when purchasing a bike, as well as some things they might not consider.</p>
    <p>
        <h3>Physical Product</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Types of Bikes
                <ul>
                    <li>Mountain Bike - designed for riding off-road, wide tires with good grip, front or full suspension, 
                        heavier and more durable on terrain, low gearing for steep inclines</li>
                    <li>Hybrid Bike - mix of mountain and road bike, narrow and slick tires, high gearing for speed, flat handlebars, higher seat position</li>
                    <li>Road Bike - narrow and slick tires, drop handlebars, rigid frame, gears for uphill and flat terrain </li>
                    <li>e-Bikes - much heavier, battery + motor, used in cities for hilly areas </li>
                  </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Variations & Components
                <ul>
                    <li>Materials - steel, aluminium, carbon fiber, titanium; steel: comfortable, durable, affordable, rusts easily; carbon fiber: more expensive, light, very strong, 
                        aerodynamic, aluminium: lightweight and stiff, won't rust, can be less comfortable</li>
                    <li>Bike should be tailored to a person's measurements - height should determine frame size (calculators & charts)</li>
                    <li>Major parts - gear, brakes, wheels</li>
                    <li>Gears: bottom gear for hills and top gear for preferred speed, usually restricted by manufacturer; Brakes: rim & disc brakes, 
                        disc brakes are less affected by the quality of the wheel, environmental particles, stop faster in wet conditions, and last longer, but rim wheels are lighter and 
                        most bikes still use them (better for replacement); Wheels: road bikes - aerodynamic, light wheels, longer distance, 
                        mountain bikes - size can determine quality of riding on the terrain</li>
                  </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Bike Users</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Who rides bikes?
                <ul>
                    <li>Recreational - casual bike riders, for children and/or families, touring</li>
                    <li>Practical - commuters, transportation</li>
                    <li>Sport - professional cyclists, mountain-biking</li>
                    <li>Age range: children - adults, elderly less likely</li>
                    <li>Location: large, busy city for commute, college campuses for students</li>
                  </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Terrain
                <p>People looking to purchase a bike would most likely consider what the purpose for their bike and the terrain. For those who are looking to commute or ride through 
                well-paved, city roads, a road bike might be more suitable. For those interested in mountain biking, off-road, or trail biking would likely look at mountain bikes. 
                Families who might ride recreationally would look for hybrid bikes that can handle both paved and mildly rough roads.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>Budget & Time?
                <ul>
                    <li>Bikes can be expensive and be an investment that requires time for maintenence and upkeep. Cheaper bikes might not be as much of a hassle to maintain but might not have as 
                        many features. Some bikes might even have "buy-now pay-later" finance options. If someone only wants a bike for local errands or short commutes, they might not want to 
                        spend as much as someone who is looking to get into cycling or training.</li>
                    <li>For me personally, I want to get the most value out of my bike. I would want it to be a good investment, so I don't mind spending a bit more on something that 
                        will work for a long time, will not break easily, and allow me to be comfortable.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Buying Experience</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sellers
                <ul>
                    <li>Online: shop multiple retailers, find exact model/brand you are looking for, can see reviews from other customers, must assemble bike yourself, no service deals, no test ride 
                        could lead to size or fit issues </li>
                    <li>In-person: people might prefer testing their bikes before riding; can get a sense of the brakes, gear, etc., may be able to negotiate the price, be measured 
                        so you can find a bike that fits you, store can help with setup and services, less choice than online retailers, brands may not be available, price is higher due 
                        to labor costs
                    </li>
                  </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Purchase Considerations
                <ul>
                    <li>Personally, I am very reliant on the rating/review system when making purchases. If it has a proper ratio of 5-star scale rating to the number of reviews, 
                        I'll generally</li>
                    <li>I know my family is much more preferable to "word of mouth" purchasing, so they'll generally ask people they know and trust to recommend them a specific 
                        brand or type of bike. </li>
                    <li>
                        Value & price - what do I lose if I spend less, what do I gain if I spend more? (diminishing returns)</li>
                    <li>
                        Deals, accessories included, maintenence (install accessories, servicing, replacement parts)</li>
                  </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Buying a Bike</h2>
        <h3> <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/"> Amazon</a></h3>
        <p> I start my search by simply typing bikes into Amazon. I often find the "Best Seller" or "Amazon's Choice" on Amazon to be decently reliable. However, this time, the "Best Seller" didn't seem to suit my needs 
            as it was a mountain bike, and I was looking more for something that would help me in my commute to campus. I refined my search to be "hybrid bikes" and selected the "Amazon's Choice" 
            option that came up. However, the price was $469, which is pretty high in my opinion. The reviews are quite good, but not enough to inspire confidence in spending that much money. 
            There is an "Editorial recommendation" as I scroll down in which I see a bike that I think would fit my need for comfortable commutes, but it's still pretty costly for my tastes.
            I keep scrolling and notice that prices seem to average around the 400s, so I eventually settle on the recommended bike. Thankfully it had it in my size, which I did not think to filter earlier.
        </p>
        <h3> <a href = "https://www.nashbar.com/"> Nashbar</a></h3>
        <p>
            I start by searching for "commute bike" in the search bar. I notice the first several bikes are 2x or more expensive than those on Amazon. There are also many that have not been 
            reviewed or only have one review. Filtering the options to those that were in stock and in my size (which is conveniently on the left-side panel), I selected the one that seemed to be the cheapest, but also still reliable, which was 
            $400. It is a lifestyle bike, but the description of the bike mentions it is suited for college campuses and a comfortable commute, so it looked good to me.
